# Learning Julia with Advent of Code

See the some of the less complete AOC repos I did for other languages:

- [AOC 2019 in Rust](https://github.com/nmyers217/advent_of_code_2019_rust)
- [AOC 2019 in Clojure](https://github.com/nmyers217/advent_of_code_2019_clojure)
- [AOC 2018 in Nim](https://github.com/nmyers217/advent_of_code_2018_nim)

The problems are on the [AOC website](https://adventofcode.com).

## Dependencies

- Julia 1.6.3

## Instructions

1. Clone the repo and `cd` into it
1. Run `julia <year>/src/<day>.jl`
